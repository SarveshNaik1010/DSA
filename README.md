# Important Maths Formulas

## 1. Summation of the First N Natural Numbers

Formula:
1 + 2 + 3 + ... + N = (N \* (N + 1)) / 2

---

Code Example (Nested Loops):

```cpp
for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
        // Code
    }
}
```

## TIP (For Patterns) - A bit of observation, maths, and bit of symmetry
